Write-Up

I have implemented a project that displays cat pictures, along with comments and rating for each picture. The functionality that is only be available to logged-in users is the ability to view and leave a rating out of 5 stars for each cat. The 4 forms in the website are the registration, signing in, adding a comment, and adding a rating forms.  There is a blueprint and two routes to get to home from the ratings and comments pages and the login page. Additionally, there will be a blueprint and two routes to the ratings page from the home and login page. MongoDB stores the rankings, comments, and login details. The api I used is the CatAPI, as this makes it easy to see the images of the cats.
